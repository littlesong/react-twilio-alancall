# INTRODUCTION

This is a demo web app that allows the user to calling US phone numbers. Currently (2022-09) this is only a basic demo version for proving the concept of making outbound phone calls from web. It only supports the following functions in this version.

- Dial any specified US phone number
- Import phone numbers from CSV file

## What's next

Next, we'll experiment the following requirements.

- Directly dial phone numbers from the imported lists
- Managing the call life cycle
    - start the call
    - monitor the call events to 
        - receives and stores the keypad response from the callee
        - track (store) the call status
- Export the result to CSV (?)
- Compose and apply TwiML call instructions
    - parameterize it

# SETUP

## Setup the dial function

Follow the following steps to deploy the **dial** function to twilio. Note. You need a twilio phone# to make it work.

- Login in to twilio console
- In **Functions and Assets** create a Service. Ie. alancall
- Create a function in the above service. Ie. dial
- Deploy the function code from /functions/src/dialphone.js. This can be done by copy the source code and paste into the function body.
- Change the function to 'Public' if it is not.
- Then press 'Deploy All' to deploy the function. Mark down the service url (ie. `alancall-5826.twil.io`)
- Test the function using the following url: https://<service-url>/<function-name>?phone=<phone#-to-dial>. For example:

    https://alancall-5826.twil.io/dial?phone=16137977535

- Update the service name and function name in the `/utils/dial-api.js` file. This is needed for the react app to call the dial function.

### View function logs

You can show live logs for debugging by loading the Services page in the Twilio Console, opening the Service to track, and clicking the Show Logs toggle in the bottom-right corner of the UI.

## Deploy the website  

Follow the following steps to deploy the REACT website to twilio. Also see https://www.twilio.com/blog/deploy-react-application-twilio-serverless-toolkit

- Install Twilio CLI tool (see https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart)
- run `twilio login`
- run `npm run deploy:twilio:react`
- Now the react app should have been deployed to twilio. Mark down the service url. Ie. `alancall-react-5626-dev.twil.io`
- Test it with the following url: https://<service-url>/index.html.


--------------
# Local Dev

    Run `npm run start`

    This will launch the website locally for development purposes.


--------------
# Web App Usage

Web app url: https://<alancall-react-service-url>/index.html

## Pages

You can select the page on the main menu.

### Call
